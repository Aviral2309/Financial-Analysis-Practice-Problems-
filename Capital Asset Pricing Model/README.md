# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

## Overview
The **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** explains the relationship between **risk** and **expected return** of a security. It helps investors estimate the return required for taking market risk.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Risk-Free Rate (rf):**  
  Return on a risk-free asset (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds).

- **Market Return (rm):**  
  Overall market return, commonly represented by the **S&P 500**.

- **Beta (β):**  
  Measures a stock’s volatility compared to the market.  
  - β = 1 → Same risk as market  
  - β < 1 → Less volatile (defensive)  
  - β > 1 → More volatile (aggressive)

---

## CAPM Formula
\[
r_i = r_f + \beta_i (r_m - r_f)
\]

Where:
- \( r_i \) = Expected return of the asset  
- \( r_f \) = Risk-free rate  
- \( r_m \) = Market return  
- \( \beta_i \) = Beta of the asset  

---

## Example (Apple Stock)
- rf = 0%  
- rm = 12.4%  
- β = 1.11  

**Expected Return:**  
\[
r = 0 + 1.11 \times 12.4\% = 13.7\%
\]

---

## Conclusion
CAPM is widely used in **investment analysis** to estimate expected returns and understand risk-return trade-offs.
