# AI-Based Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** can be applied to **stock price prediction**.  
We use **Ridge Regression** and **Deep Learning (ANN & LSTM)** models to analyze historical stock price data and forecast future prices.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: Stock prices are volatile and hard to predict. This project is for educational purposes only.

---

## Objectives
- Predict future stock prices using historical data
- Compare traditional ML with deep learning models
- Understand regularization and time-series forecasting

---

## Models Used
- **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)** – reduces overfitting
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** – best suited for time-series data

---

## Workflow
1. Data preprocessing & normalization  
2. Model training (Ridge, LSTM)  
3. Prediction & visualization  
4. Performance comparison  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib  

---

## Key Takeaway
LSTM outperforms traditional regression models for **time-series stock prediction**, highlighting the power of deep learning in financial analytics.
