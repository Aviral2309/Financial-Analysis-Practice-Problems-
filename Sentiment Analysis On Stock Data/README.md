# Stock Market Sentiment Analysis using NLP

## Overview
We live in a world where people constantly share opinions through social media feeds, tweets, and news articles. This large amount of unstructured text data can be used to predict public sentiment toward a particular company or stock.

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI/ML models to analyze tweets and classify them as positive or negative. The extracted sentiment can be used as an additional factor while making buy/sell decisions in the stock market.

## How It Works
1. Collect tweets related to stocks or companies.
2. Apply NLP techniques to convert text into numerical features.
3. Train an AI/ML model on the processed data.
4. Predict sentiment for each tweet.
5. Use sentiment results for market analysis or decision support.

## Example Tweets and Sentiment

Input:
EXX is tempting to breakout above 14.50 following an eps beat and with positive trends. #breakout  
Output:
Positive (Label = 1)

Input:
APPL get back down here!!! so silly.  
Output:
Negative (Label = 0)

## System Flow
Tweets → NLP Preprocessing → Sentiment Detection Model → Sentiment Label

## Sentiment Labels
Positive : Label = 1  
Negative : Label = 0
